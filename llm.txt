I utilised github copilot to write some boilerplate code and help with later refactoring.
Chatgpt was mainly used to troubleshoot initial issues with Dockerfiles e.g. missing
dependencies and further consulting with the distro image settings. LLM is still
in very early phases so it takes a lot of effort to get prompts aligned with the
expected results. I'm still not very used to the LLMs, so it may not even make progress
faster over just roaming Stackoverflow for answers (which I normally do).
